So I started this with a few objectives and I'd like to not only share but also have a place to check back in the future.

**I started a blog to:**

1. Develop my communication skills
2. Showcase my knowledge for possible interviews/ recruiters
3. Learn frontend
4. Understand my proficiency as a teacher
5. Test the waters for an possible income stream
6. Kick start a following
7. Kick start an youtube career/ project

**I'll start a youtube channel with similar gos:**

1. Develop my communication skills
2. Develop my presentation and live talking skills
3. Learn to edit videos and pictures
4. Learn to use a camera to its fullest
5. Test the waters for an possible income stream

The trick here is that I'm doing these things in order to learn skills (a lot of then) as a hobby.

If it turns out that I like it and I have some knack on doing it, I'll have already built something to start with

Thats it!
